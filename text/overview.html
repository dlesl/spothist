  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    Ever since Spotify started to make playlists like "Your top songs
    2019" and "Summer Rewind", I've thought it would be nice to be able
    to analyse this data myself. How about a "Winter Rewind", for
    example?</p>

  <p>How do I get my hands on this data? I tried Spotify's "download your
    data" feature, but it only goes back a few months. The next best
    option was
    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-recently-played/">
      this API</a>
    which returns the 50 most recently played tracks. Since a track needs
    to be played for 30 seconds to register, all that's required is to
    check for new plays every 25 minutes. This webapp does exactly that.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    As soon as I started testing the above API call, I realised that the
    data I was going to be accumulating would include things like the
    number of times I listened to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNWmOtvkQkE">Cruel</a>
    this month, making it even more sensitive than bank statements!
  </p>

  <p>
    To avoid having this data sitting around in plaintext on a server
    somewhere, use of encryption was essential. The scheme used is quite simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you sign up, you generate a keypair consisting of a public
    and private key. The server receives only the public key; the
    private key is your responsibility, and without it you will not be
    able to access your data (nor will anyone else). When the server
    retrieves your playback data, as soon as it is received it is
    stored in a
    <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">
      libsodium sealed box
    </a>.
    The server doesn't (and can't) do anything more with it except store
    it. When you later want to access your data, you need to log in with
    your spotify account <b>and</b> provide your keypair. The data is only
    decrypted locally in the browser, and never sent to the server.
  </p>

  <h2>Data analysis</h2>

  <p>
    Having this data in a nice SQL database on the server but not being
    able to query it (since it consists solely of encrypted BLOBs) would
    be a bit frustrating. The solution was to run
    <a href="https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/">SQLite in the browser</a>.
    You can query and manipulate and
    export your data as you please, and I will never know that you only
    listen to that one Avril Lavigne album from 2002 on repeat.
